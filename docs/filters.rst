How Filters Work
----------------

Thumbor handles filters in a pipeline. This means that they
run sequentially in the order they are specified!
Given an original image with size :math:`60x40` and the
following transformations:

   http://localhost:8888/fit-in/100x100/filters:watermark(..):blur(..):fill(red,1):upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthumbor%2Fthumbor%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fexample.jpg

The resulting image will first check if it can fit into a :math:`100x100`. Since it does,
the filter pipeline will kick in and:

* add the watermark in the image;
* blur the whole image (including the watermark);
* Fill the outer parts of the image with red (so it will fit in :math:`100x100`);
* Then it will try to upscale. This will have no effect, since at this point the image is already :math:`100x100`.
