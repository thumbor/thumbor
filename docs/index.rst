Whats Thumbor?
--------------

Thumbor is a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand crop, resizing
and flipping of images.

It features a VERY smart detection of important points in the image for
better cropping and resizing, using state-of-the-art face and feature
detection algorithms (more on that in :doc:`detection_algorithms`).

Using thumbor is very easy (after it is running). All you have to do is
access it using an URL for an image, like this::

    http://thumbor-server/unsafe/300x200/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthumbor%2Fthumbor%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fexample.jpg

That URL would show an image of the Big Brother Brasil participants in
300x200 using smart crop. There are several other options to the image
URL configuration. You can check them in the :doc:`usage`
page. For more details on the /unsafe part of the URL, check the
:doc:`security` page.

The safe url for the above URL would look like (check :doc:`security` for
more details)::

    http://thumbor-server/K97LekICOXT9MbO3X1u8BBkrjbu5/300x200/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthumbor%2Fthumbor%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fexample.jpg

.. warning::
    Release 7.0.0 introduces a major breaking change due to the migration to python 3
    and the modernization of our codebase. Please read the
    `release notes <https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/releases>`_
    for details on how to upgrade.
