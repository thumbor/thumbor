* Add pluggable metrics

configuration setting `METRICS` defaults to `thumbor.metrics.logger_metrics`

possible values are:

* `thumbor.metrics.logger_metrics`
* `thumbor.metrics.statsd_metrics`
* `thumbor.metrics.librato_metrics`

see the respective sections in the `config.py` (`STATSD_XYZ`, `LIBRATO_XYZ`)

please note that `context.statsd_client` is deprecated and will be removed, use `context.metrics` instead!

Release 5.0.0 (5.0.0)
# WHY the major release?

Thumbor's storage and result storage all used synchronous interfaces. That's not an issue per-se, but it's not the proper way to use tornado. 

Several users were having issues in production due to timeouts and broken requests. 

We were at a cross-roads. Fix the issue in a "broken" way but without any breaking changes, or go with what the community feels is the right way for thumbor to go, while being incompatible with currently developed extensions.

We felt we needed to fix this in a way that felt "right". Hopefully we'll be more aligned with future evolutions of tornado.

With the help of the community we were able to fix this issue and make thumbor more robust, more scalable and more predictable.

Feedback on this is highly encouraged. Feel free to create issues if something is amiss.

# WARNING

> This version contains breaking changes. If you use your own version of a Storage or ResultStorage, all of those are async now and should return a Future. For more info, check the built-in one from thumbor's codebase.

# BREAKING Changes

* Async contract for all of thumbor's imported modules #459. thanks @masom 

# Changes

* Tornado updated to 4.1
* Better GifEngine error handling  #448. thanks @masom 
* Fixing error log on cache miss  #453. thanks @dhardy92 
* Meta now has frame count #451
* Https loader and strict https loader added  #471. thanks @lukaselmer

## WARNING

If you've upgraded to the 4.2.0 release it's VERY, VERY recommended that you upgrade to 4.2.1 as soon as possible.

[pypi release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thumbor/4.2.1)

Release 4.2.0 (4.2.0)
This release adds official support for GIFs and Animated GIFs.

* Fixes #297 - With the new engine, gifs that were once distorted are perfectly valid now.

## Supporting GIFs the new way

If you want to use the new gif engine there are two things you must do:

a) You need to install [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/). Most operating systems have packages for it and in Mac OS it's just `brew install gifsicle`.
b) You must include a configuration in your .conf file that says `USE_GIFSICLE_ENGINE=True`.

## WARNING

With the use of gifsicle engine, no filters will work for the gif images (all the other images will be fine). The same happens with smart cropping.

This release has a bug that was fixed in 4.2.1. If you are using 4.2.0, please upgrade as soon as posssible.

If your current release is greater than 4.0.0, be advised you must upgrade as soon as possible. If your release is lesser than 4.0.0, please consider upgrading for better support.

* Fixes #305 - This is a **critical** bug. Images will be served with Exif data, meaning they can potentially be many times heavier than they should be.

# BREAKING Changes

* Removed thumbor.engines.opencv in favor of the new [opencv-engine](https://github.com/thumbor/opencv-engine) project. That's where we'll maintain the OpenCV engine.
* Removed thumbor.engines.graphicsmagick in favor of the new [graphicsmagick-engine](https://github.com/thumbor/graphicsmagick-engine) project. That's where we'll maintain the GraphicsMagick engine.

# New features

* New convolution filter by [Cezar Sá](https://github.com/cezarsa);
* New Gaussian Bluer filter by [Cezar Sá](https://github.com/cezarsa);

Release 3.14.7 (3.14.7)
