Release 5.0.0 (5.0.0)
# WHY the major release?

Thumbor's storage and result storage all used synchronous interfaces. That's not an issue per-se, but it's not the proper way to use tornado.

Several users were having issues in production due to timeouts and broken requests.

We were at a cross-roads. Fix the issue in a "broken" way but without any breaking changes, or go with what the community feels is the right way for thumbor to go, while being incompatible with currently developed extensions.

We felt we needed to fix this in a way that felt "right". Hopefully we'll be more aligned with future evolutions of tornado.

With the help of the community we were able to fix this issue and make thumbor more robust, more scalable and more predictable.

Feedback on this is highly encouraged. Feel free to create issues if something is amiss.

# WARNING

> This version contains breaking changes. If you use your own version of a Storage or ResultStorage, all of those are async now and should return a Future. For more info, check the built-in one from thumbor's codebase.

# BREAKING Changes
- Async contract for all of thumbor's imported modules #459. thanks @masom

# Changes
- Tornado updated to 4.1
- Better GifEngine error handling  #448. thanks @masom
- Fixing error log on cache miss  #453. thanks @dhardy92
- Meta now has frame count #451
- Https loader and strict https loader added  #471. thanks @lukaselmer

This release introduces the possibility to use [optimizers](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/wiki/Optimizers). A JPEGTRAN optimizer has been created as a sample optimizer. Other optimizers (pngquant, gifsicle and the like) can be created as contributed libraries by the community.

It also adds the following contributions:

* Now thumbor supports HEAD requests. This was a contribution by @justinribeiro;
* We also feature blacklisting of images. This was a contribution by @clifff.

## WARNING

If you've upgraded to the 4.2.0 release it's VERY, VERY recommended that you upgrade to 4.2.1 as soon as possible.

[Diff to previous release](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/compare/4.2.0...4.2.1)
[pypi release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thumbor/4.2.1)

Release 4.2.0 (4.2.0)
This release adds official support for GIFs and Animated GIFs.

* Fixes #297 - With the new engine, gifs that were once distorted are perfectly valid now.

## Supporting GIFs the new way

If you want to use the new gif engine there are two things you must do:

a) You need to install [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/). Most operating systems have packages for it and in Mac OS it's just `brew install gifsicle`.
b) You must include a configuration in your .conf file that says `USE_GIFSICLE_ENGINE=True`.

## WARNING

With the use of gifsicle engine, no filters will work for the gif images (all the other images will be fine). The same happens with smart cropping.

This release has a bug that was fixed in 4.2.1. If you are using 4.2.0, please upgrade as soon as posssible.

If your current release is greater than 4.0.0, be advised you must upgrade as soon as possible. If your release is lesser than 4.0.0, please consider upgrading for better support.

* Fixes #305 - This is a **critical** bug. Images will be served with Exif data, meaning they can potentially be many times heavier than they should be.

# WARNING

> This version contains breaking changes. Both GraphicsMagick and OpenCV engines were removed from the built-in imaging engines and can be found in the [thumbor organization](http://github.com/thumbor) now. For more information on using each of them check the respective project documentation.

# BREAKING Changes

* Removed thumbor.engines.opencv in favor of the new [opencv-engine](https://github.com/thumbor/opencv-engine) project. That's where we'll maintain the OpenCV engine.
* Removed thumbor.engines.graphicsmagick in favor of the new [graphicsmagick-engine](https://github.com/thumbor/graphicsmagick-engine) project. That's where we'll maintain the GraphicsMagick engine.

This is an unstable release.

Release 3.13.3 (3.13.3)

Added some extra logging in the finish request stage.

Release 3.12.1 (3.12.1)
* Fixed leak of Redis connections when using queued detectors.

Release 3.11.1 (3.11.1)
* Finished webp support;
* Fixed a bug with webp support that would pass 'None' as format if no format specified;
* Added a configuration `PRESERVE_EXIF_INFO` that when set to True will keep the exif metadata in images intact (including webp resulting images).

Release 3.12.0 (3.12.0)
* Fixed an issue with animated gifs (sigh);
* Add detection support for WEBP format. Merge pull request [#194](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/pull/194) from dhardy92:feature_Add_WEBP_Detection;
